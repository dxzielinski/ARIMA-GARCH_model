# ARIMA-GARCH_model
The aim of this project is to analyse S&P500 prices. I focus on statistical point of view.

I am a passionate of ecomomics and I play in a stock exchange for about 2 years so I decided to build a model, that can be kind of a "helper tool" for me. This model will be a way to help me with market analysis (of course other macroeconomical indices should also be taken into consideration - this model is only one tool, so I'll treat its predictions as a hint for me).

Variables I choose for this model:

oil (crude oil) - prices depend on transport costs so crude oil as one of a significant ingredient of fuels should affect companies' profits. It means that it should be taken into consideration as a statistically important variable.

natgas (natural gas) - it also affects transport costs. Moreover it's important energy source.

gold - it is a commodity mostly used as a 'safe investment', so the highest gold price, the less investors are attracted to S&P500 (because they will be interested in growing commodities/market sectors), so then the S&P500 price should be lower. Moreover gold is widely used in technological sector for example to produce cables and components for electronical devices.

corn - one of important cereal, which affects food prices, so problably also should be taken into consideration

steelStock (US Steel Corporation Stock) - steel is a good example of an industrial metal, which is important for some business sectors, so I decided to choose one of Stock which price is strongly correlated with steel price

EURUSD (exchange rate) - it affects on a competitivness of US economy. Export and import will be strongly correlated with relative dolar value, so it also should influence S&P500 index price.

I decided to enclose more comments and explainations in Jupyter Notebook file to make my model more transparent.

I will be sistematically updating this model.
